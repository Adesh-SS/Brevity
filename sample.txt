Ukraine has launched a “large-scale” drone attack against Russian military bombers in Siberia, striking more than 40 warplanes thousands of miles from its own territory, a security official has said, after it smuggled the drones to the perimeter of the airfields hidden in the roofs of wooden sheds.
On the eve of peace talks, the drone attack on four separate airfields was part of a sharp ramping up of the three-year war, with Russia launching waves of drones at Ukraine, while Moscow said sabotage was to blame for two train derailments that left seven people dead.
Video from several military airfields across Russia showed destroyed aircraft and planes engulfed in flames, though the full extent of the damage remained unclear.
Among the more than 40 aircraft reportedly hit were Tu-95 and Tu-22 strategic bombers, which Russia uses to fire long-range missiles at Ukrainian cities.
Ukraine’s SBU domestic intelligence agency said it had hit Russian military planes worth a combined $7bn (£5.2bn) in the wave of drone strikes.
If the extent of the damage is confirmed, the attack would mark Ukraine’s most damaging drone strike of the war to date, amid an escalation in cross-border incursions before a new round of direct negotiations in Istanbul on Monday.
A Ukrainian official provided video footage to media reportedly showing the strikes, in which Reuters said several large aircraft that appeared to be Tu-95 bombers were on fire. The Tu-95 was originally developed to carry nuclear bombs and now launches cruise missiles.
Several Russian and Ukrainian media outlets reported that Ukraine carried out the operation by launching drones from lorries parked near military airfields deep inside Russia.
Ukrainian officials told the media that the operation – codename “Spiderweb” – had been in preparation for more than 18 months. The drones were first smuggled into Russia and later concealed under the roofs of small wooden sheds which were loaded on to trucks and driven to the perimeter of the airbases. The roof panels of the sheds were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack, the official said.

Media reports said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had personally overseen the sophisticated operation.
On Sunday evening he thanked everyone involved, adding: “We had been preparing the operation for more than a year and a half. Planning, organisation, all the details were perfectly prepared. I can say for sure that this is a completely unique operation.”
He said that the office of Ukraine’s operation in Russia had been located “right next to the FSB office in one of (Russia’s) regions”.
“In total, 117 drones were used in the operation. And a corresponding number of drone operators were working,” he said. “Thirty-four per cent of the strategic cruise missile carriers at the airfields were hit. Our people were operating in different Russian regions – in three time zones. And our people were withdrawn from the territory of Russia on the eve of the operation, and now they are safe – those who helped us.”


Scientists at a leading research institute have developed a new technique to recycle plastic waste into high-quality raw materials, offering hope for a more sustainable future. The method uses a combination of enzymes and heat to break down various types of plastic into their base chemicals, which can then be reused to make new products.
Traditionally, recycling has been limited by the type and cleanliness of the plastic, with only certain types being reusable. The new method overcomes this limitation, allowing mixed plastic waste, including food containers, bottles, and wrappers, to be processed together. The team claims their approach can convert up to 90% of plastic waste into reusable material.
The breakthrough was announced after successful pilot tests in three countries. According to the lead scientist, Dr. Elena Rodriguez, “Our goal is to close the loop in plastic manufacturing. This technology can be integrated with existing recycling plants without major modifications.”
Environmental groups have praised the innovation, calling it a “game-changer” in the fight against pollution. However, some critics caution that reducing plastic production is still more important than recycling alone. Governments are now considering policies to subsidize the adoption of this technology in large-scale recycling facilities.
The research team is currently working with industry partners to scale up the process. If successful, this could significantly reduce the amount of plastic ending up in oceans and landfills, marking a major step toward solving the global plastic crisis.

In the heart of an ancient and dense forest lay a hidden valley known to very few. The canopy overhead was so thick that sunlight filtered through in fractured beams, creating an ever-shifting tapestry of light and shadow on the emerald-green floor. Towering trees with gnarled trunks rose like silent sentinels, their roots weaving through the earth in a tangled maze. Moss and ferns blanketed every inch of the forest’s floor, lending the air a damp, earthy perfume. The valley’s atmosphere was alive with the hum of unseen creatures—chirps and rustles that hinted at the bustling ecosystem concealed within.

It was here that the scholarly botanist Professor Alicia Mortimer discovered a phenomenon that would change her perception of plant life forever. While pursuing a rare orchid rumored to bloom only once every seventy-seven years, she stumbled upon a grove of luminescent fungi. These pale, ghostly mushrooms exuded a soft, phosphorescent glow, their delicate caps hovering just above the moist ground. This unexpected discovery, hidden deep within the valley’s core, pulsed gently like bioluminescent lanterns embedded in the earth.

Professor Mortimer, meticulous in her habits, set up a temporary research station nearby. She documented each species meticulously—photographing, measuring, and recording everything with exacting precision in her leather-bound field journal. The fungus displayed remarkable behavior: during the night’s darker hours, it intensified its glow, as though responding to the absence of external light; and as dawn broke, it dimmed again, almost shyly. She theorized that this bioluminescent quality served an ecological purpose—perhaps to attract nighttime pollinators or to deter fungi-consuming insects. Collecting minute samples, she made a mental note to analyze their chemical composition in the lab once she returned to civilization.

On the third night of her observations, however, something extraordinary occurred. A low, resonant hum began to pervade the clearing. At first, Professor Mortimer believed it was the wind—or possibly the rumble of distant earth shifting. But the sound grew clearer, subtler, almost musical. She looked around, her pulse quickening, as dozens of the glowing mushrooms began to sway in unison. Their luminescent caps pulsed in synchronized rhythm with the hum, as though they were dancing to a melody only they could hear.

Heart pounding, she retrieved her voice recorder, pressed ‘record,’ and whispered in awe: “Unbelievable…they’re…communicating.” She noted that the mushrooms’ glow appeared correlated with fluctuations in the hum’s frequency. Intrigued, she positioned herself under the gentle luminescence and recorded the phenomenon’s cadence, confident that she had witnessed something far beyond a simple biochemical reaction—perhaps even a form of plant or fungal communication mediated through light and sound.

The following morning brought new revelations. Professor Mortimer discovered small, crystal-clear droplets on the underside of the fungus caps. These droplets, she observed, pulsed with the same rhythm as the glow and the hum. Curious, she touched one with a gloved fingertip, only to recoil as it emitted a tiny jolt that traveled up her finger. The sensation was not painful but startling—like a mild electric shock. She quickly documented the event, careful to make no further contact without proper equipment.

By afternoon, she had collected samples of the dripping fluid and transferred them into sealed vials. Another startling observation emerged: wherever the droplets landed—on moss, dead wood, or decaying leaves—the ground around them showed tiny signs of new growth. Thin, pale tendrils emerged from the soil, reaching toward the light of the sunlit openings. It was as if the droplets possessed regenerative or growth-promoting qualities. Dead plant matter sometimes shifted, uprooting itself slightly, as though stirred to action by the life-giving fluid.

That night, the phenomenon intensified. The mushrooms glowed brighter than ever, their collective hum evolving into a harmonious chord that reverberated through the valley’s walls. Professor Mortimer, notebook open and lantern set to its lowest dim, felt both exhilaration and trepidation. She realized that she had discovered not merely a biological curiosity but a potential key to new forms of ecological interaction. The boundary between plant, fungus, and environment seemed to blur in that clearing—a living, breathing nexus of energy and communication.

She questioned the implications. Could this hollow in the undergrowth represent a remnant of ancient symbiotic networks? Perhaps an evolutionary link between fungal bioluminescence and biophysical signaling pathways? And what if the secret held within these glowing mushrooms offered applications in biotechnology, agriculture, or even medicine? With trembling handwriting, she penned her excitement alongside sober notes on experimental protocols.

As midnight approached, a sudden chill settled over the valley. Mist crept in from unseen springs, coiling around roots and trunks, rising to cloak the clearing. The mushrooms’ glow dimmed in response—as though shrouded by the moisture-laden fog. The hum ceased. Silence fell, thick and complete. Alicia Mortimer held her breath, scanning her surroundings with wide eyes, aware that an unseen observer might be watching—if only the forest itself.

That night, she slept fitfully beneath her tarp shelter, dreams haunted by ghostly lights and humming chords. She awoke before dawn, compelled to return to the grove. Stillness reigned; there was no glow, no hum. Only the steady drip of condensation from leaves overhead. She knelt between the towering trunks, heart heavy with the weight of unanswered questions. Had she imagined the entire display? Was it gone forever, or preparing a grander revelation? Gathering her notes and carefully packing her equipment, she prepared for her journey home—knowing that her life’s work had forever changed.
